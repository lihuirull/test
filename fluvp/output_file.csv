PB2-T224A/E627K, PB1-K577E, and PA-T97I/D514E, were found in the viral polymerase subunits PB2, PB1, and PA. As shown in Figure 6, the polymerase activity of the RNP from the two MA H6 viruses was significantly higher than corresponding WT viruses, which suggested that the two H6 viruses with these mutations in RNP increased virulence in mice.

PB2-T224A/E627K, PB1-K577E, and PA-T97I/D514E, were found in the viral polymerase subunits PB2, PB1, and PA. As shown in Figure 6, the polymerase activity of the RNP from the two MA H6 viruses was significantly higher than corresponding WT viruses, which suggested that the two H6 viruses with these mutations in RNP increased virulence in mice.
